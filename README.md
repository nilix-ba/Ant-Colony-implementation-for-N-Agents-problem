# Ant-Colony-implementation-for-N-Agents-problem

Implementation of Ant Colony to solve the N-Agents problem. The problem instance has n agents and n tasks. Any agent can be assigned to perform any task, incurring some cost that may vary depending on the agent-task assignment. It is required to perform as many tasks as possible by assigning at most one agent to each task and at most one task to each agent, in such a way that the total cost of the assignment is minimized.
